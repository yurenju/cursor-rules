# Git Commit Rules

This document outlines the complete workflow and message format specifications for AI-performed Git commits.

## Git Workflow (AI Usage)

Before committing, follow these steps:

1. **Review Current State**: Check status, differences, and history in one command

   ```bash
   # Combined command for efficiency - check status, differences, and recent history
   export GIT_PAGER=cat && git status && echo "=== CHANGES ===" && git diff && echo "=== RECENT COMMITS ===" && git log --oneline -5
   ```

2. **Analyze Changes and Suggest Commit Strategy**: Based on the degree of file changes, decide whether to split into multiple commits

   **Analysis Criteria**:

   - **Single commit**: If changes belong to the same logical function or modification scope
   - **Multiple commits**: If changes involve multiple different functions, file types, or modification purposes

   **Situations requiring multiple commits**:

   - Simultaneously modified API and frontend components
   - Contains both new features and bug fixes (different types of changes)
   - Modified code in multiple different modules
   - Simultaneously performing feature addition and code refactoring
   - Contains both documentation updates and program logic modifications

   **AI Behavior**:

   - If suggesting multiple commits, must:
     1. List suggested commit groupings
     2. Provide suggested message format for each commit
     3. List files that should be included in each commit
     4. **Stop execution**, wait for user confirmation or adjustment suggestions
   - If judged as single commit, continue with subsequent steps

   **Suggestion Format Example**:

   ```
   Suggested split into 2 commits:

   Commit 1: Add user authentication API
   - Files: services/auth/auth.api.ts, services/auth/auth.types.ts
   - Message: feat(auth): add user authentication API

   Commit 2: Update project configuration
   - Files: package.json, tsconfig.json
   - Message: chore: update TypeScript configuration

   Please confirm whether to proceed with this suggestion, or tell me your adjustments.
   ```

3. **Add Files**: Add files to staging area and confirm

   ```bash
   # For specific files
   git add filename && git status

   # For all changed files (only when confirmed as single commit)
   git add . && git status
   ```

4. **Commit and Verify**: Use Conventional Commits format for committing and verify result

   ```bash
   git commit -m "type(scope): description" && git status && git log --oneline -3
   ```

### Complete Example Workflow

#### Single Commit Workflow

```bash
# 1. Review current state (combined command)
export GIT_PAGER=cat && git status && echo "=== CHANGES ===" && git diff && echo "=== RECENT COMMITS ===" && git log --oneline -5

# 2. Analyze changes (AI judges as single commit)

# 3. Add files and confirm staging
git add services/auth/auth.api.ts && git status

# 4. Commit and verify
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user authentication API" && git status && git log --oneline -3
```

#### Multiple Commits Workflow

```bash
# 1-2. Same as above, AI analyzes and suggests multiple commits then stops waiting for confirmation

# After user confirmation, execute first commit:
git add services/auth/auth.api.ts services/auth/auth.types.ts && git status
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user authentication API" && git status && git log --oneline -2

# Execute second commit:
git add package.json tsconfig.json && git status
git commit -m "chore: update TypeScript configuration" && git status && git log --oneline -2
```

## Commit Message Format Specifications

### Conventional Commits Format Structure

```
type(scope): description
```

### Detailed Description

#### Type

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation update
- **style**: Code formatting changes (no functional impact)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring (no new features or bug fixes)
- **test**: Add or modify tests
- **chore**: Build tools, auxiliary tools, or dependency updates
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **ci**: CI/CD related changes
- **build**: Build system or external dependency changes

#### Scope (Optional)

- Indicates the scope or module affected by the change
- Examples: auth, api, ui, database, config
- Can be omitted if affecting multiple scopes

#### Description

- Use present tense verbs, concisely describe the change content
- Start with lowercase, no period at the end
- Recommended length within 50 characters

### Commit Message Examples

#### Feature Development

```
feat(auth): add user authentication API
feat(ui): implement login form validation
feat: add password reset functionality
```

#### Bug Fixes

```
fix(api): resolve login timeout issue
fix(ui): correct form validation error display
fix: prevent memory leak in data processing
```

#### Documentation Updates

```
docs: update API documentation
docs(readme): add installation instructions
```

#### Refactoring

```
refactor(auth): simplify token validation logic
refactor: extract common utility functions
```

#### Testing

```
test(auth): add unit tests for login API
test: improve test coverage for user service
```

#### Build and Configuration

```
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
chore(config): update TypeScript configuration
build: add Docker support for development
```

#### Performance Improvements

```
perf(api): optimize database query performance
perf: reduce bundle size by 20%
```

#### CI/CD

```
ci: add automated testing workflow
ci: update deployment configuration
```

## Notes

### General Notes

- Use `export GIT_PAGER=cat` at the beginning of git command sequences to ensure output is displayed without pagination
- Avoid using `git commit -a` to directly commit all changes; must first use `git add` to explicitly select files to commit
- Must check `git diff` before committing to ensure change content is correct
- To understand previous commit content or confirm message format, use `git log --oneline -5` to view recent records, adjust number as needed

### Conventional Commits Notes

- Must use specified type categories, cannot create custom ones
- Scope should be concise and clear, reflecting actual program modules or functional scope
- Description uses present tense verbs, avoid past tense
- For breaking changes, add `!` before description, e.g., `feat!: remove deprecated API`
- Maintain consistency, use same type and scope for similar types of changes

### Multiple Commit Strategy Notes

- **AI must analyze first**: Before executing `git add`, AI must first analyze change content and determine if multiple commits are needed
- **Stop and wait for confirmation**: If AI suggests multiple commits, must stop execution and wait for user confirmation, cannot decide to continue independently
- **Clear suggestion format**: Multiple commit suggestions must include file list and suggested message for each commit
- **Logical grouping**: Each commit should represent a complete logical change, avoid putting unrelated modifications in the same commit
- **Execute in order**: Multiple commits should be executed in logical order, e.g., commit basic configuration first, then feature changes
- **Independence**: Each commit should be independently functional, should not depend on subsequent commits to work properly
